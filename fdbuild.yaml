# Project settings file for FDbuild
#
# This file defines a FDBuild project in the directory it is
# located in. Its settings are applied to sub-projects and
# modules, but they can overwrite specific values in their own
# setting files, which then apply to all further sub-projects
# and modules in their directory hierarchy.
#
# To reset the setting values here, delete this file. The
# file will be regenerated the next time you run FDbuild.
#

# list subprojects - uninducible
# list only '/': all subdirectories (excl. 'src' and 'build')
